lib sql cache
=============

Experimental lib to cache data on SQLite.

:: requirements ::

You need to install:

Check (http://check.sourceforge.net)
SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org)

You can get them manually or running the usual brew, apt-get or yum for your platform and install it. Of course, you also need GCC, make and all the basic C libs. Usually a build-essentials package should be enough.

:: how to use ::

:: developing ::

Just run make to have the test suite built and executed. After that you're on your own.

Bye!
